# Real-Time-Analytics-Pipeline-with-Apache-Flink-Kafka-StarRocks
A full-stack streaming pipeline that ingests simulated clickstream data (~10K events/min) using Kafka, processes it in real time with Apache Flink, and stores the results in StarRocks for low-latency OLAP queries. Includes dbt-based modeling, CDC via Debezium, and orchestration with Docker Compose.
